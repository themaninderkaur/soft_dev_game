The lot will be torn down by Mayor Carpenter and resplaced with new buildings, and your job is to create a more livley and welcoming atmosphere to the lot. 

To play the game, you will go on missions trying to find food matches and best serve your customers. Alongside the matching game, you can also explore a storyline. Develop friendship (and relationships) between other charecters, play minigames and go on fun side quests.
