Competitive Analysis
--------------------

Cooking Simulator – The sim is good with graphics and using physics, yet is a 3D video game, thus would 
not exactly help our game. Despite this, we can use the layout of the cooking space, the food and the 
instructions for our game. Our game will most defiantly lack in graphics and the physics will not be the
same as the 3D Game. Another interesting aspect is the first person POV. Our video game should also take
the first person POV. The sim also has realistic sounds for the customers when they arrive, get 
frustrated, and leave. These sound effects allow the player to know to hurry up and signifies an 
important aspect to consider in the game. Having a silent game would be very drab, thus sound effects are
needed, for helping and for comedic relief. 

Overcooked – The game has a very different way of cooking in their game. The complexity is far too 
advanced. The 3D is more manageable as the character design is very simple. The characters simply move,
and no joints are to be taken into consideration. We can use the weird wacky way to cook as inspiration
way for our own game. The graphics are much cuter, and that would fit within our soft, cute storyline. 
The characters also each have their own role and assist the player in the instructions. In our game we 
should utilize the use of characters to get the instructions across. Despite this one possible flaw in 
the game is lack of storyline. The game is often repetitive and many Steam reviews state the same.

She does like cooking games that have a storyline going alongside the main game as the tasks don’t become repetitive. 

 

Gaming Frustrations: She thinks many video games are either too repetitive or too complex. She wants a nice mix of the two, especially when it comes to cooking games. At the same time, she believes that a good wholesome story between characters is needed. S
